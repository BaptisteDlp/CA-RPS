## Usage

The following is required to run this code: <br>
<ul>
 <li> a C++ compiler </li>
 <li> SDL 1 + SDL_image1.2 librairies </li>
 <li> Gnuplot (optional but recommanded) </li>
</ul>


On Linux distribution: <br>

<ul>
 <li> Open a terminal </li>
 <li> (To install SDL dependancies) <strong> sudo apt install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev </strong> </li>
 <li> Clone this project on a local repository </li>
 <li> Move to the project repository</li>
 <li> Enter <strong> make </strong> into the console </li>
</ul>

Once these steps are done, the code is compiled and you can run it entering:<br>
<ul>
  <li> <strong> ./bin/main data/map.txt density_rock density_paper </strong>  </li>
</ul>

where <strong> density_rock </strong> and <strong> density_paper </strong> are positive integers < 1 representing respectively the initial density of rock and paper
